Following the same trend is the number of available applications and services place at disposal in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). Conversely, video services are commonly referred as one of the most stringent applications, on the grounds that it requires a quality-aware steady and uninterrupted flow of information. Because of that, a number of challenges arose, including how to deal with the scarce network resources, the high-error rates and the time-varying channel conditions. This unveils the need for an adaptive video-aware and Quality of Experience (QoE)-driven mechanism to take care of these challenges and deliver video sequences with good quality.&&&2016 Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop&&&21/6/2016&&&Vilanova i la Geltru, Spain

Despite their popularity, the use of these protocols brings two limitations to applications and systems that require reliable interactive real-time communications: 1) HTTP forces applications to work in a request-response paradigm, even if a reply is not necessary, not allowing the server to send anything to a client without the client explicitly requesting it; 2) TCP provides no recovery options for network outages, thus forcing developers to write their own error-prone, complex, and ad hoc solutions.&&&2014 20th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems&&&17/12/2014&&&Hsinchu, Taiwan
1&&&Fernando Barros,Leonor Melo,Charles Goncalves&&&SSE&&&A parametric QoE video quality estimator for Wireless Networks&&&Streaming media, Multimedia communication, Quality assessment, Video recording, Real-time systems&&&2012&&&73&&&The development of real-time quality estimator schemes for emerging Internet videos with different content types remains a significant challenge and is crucial for the success of wireless multimedia systems. However, currently in-service assessment schemes fail in capturing subjective aspects of multimedia content related to the user perception. Therefore, this paper proposes an on-the-fly parametric video quality estimator approach (called MultiQoE) for real-time video streaming applications. Experiments in a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) scenario were carried out to show the accuracy, benefit, and impact of MultiQoE compared to widely used Quality of Experience (QoE) subjective, objective and parametric methods.&&&2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops&&&5/5/2012&&&Anaheim, USA

In this context, how can we efficiently and effectively manage different types of IoT data sources? In this paper, we propose a solution to manage different types of sensors/actuators and analyze which management protocols are best in terms of performance. The proposal is based on open and broadly adopted technologies in IoT, with emphasis on the FIWARE middleware.&&&IEEE Internet of Things Journal&&&10/11/2020&&&3030141

The circulant hash is a variant of Carter and Wegman’s H3 hash as well as Krawczyk’s Toeplitz hash, both of which are hashes based on matrix-vector multiplication over F2. In this paper we revisit the circulant hash and reinterpret it as a multiplication in the polynomial ring. This leads to simpler proofs, faster implementations in modern computer chips, and newer variants with practical implementation advantages.&&&Journal of Mathematical Cryptology&&&3/12/2018&&&946058

The review is contextualized within related research from psychology, philosophy, and particularly artificial intelligence. Influenced by psychological theories of surprise, the model assumes that surprise‐eliciting events initiate a series of cognitive processes that begin with the appraisal of the event as unexpected, continue with the interruption of ongoing activity and the focusing of attention on the unexpected event, and culminate in the analysis and evaluation of the event and the revision of beliefs. It is assumed that the intensity of surprise elicited by an event is a nonlinear function of the difference or contrast between the subjective probability of the event and that of the most probable alternative event (which is usually the expected event); and that the agent's behavior is partly controlled by actual and anticipated surprise.&&&Wiley Online Library&&&17/8/2017&&&645132

While many CPSs are humancentric applications where humans are an essential part of the system, unfortunately, most of these systems still consider the human as an external and unpredictable element to the control loop. In order for these systems to better serve human needs, future CPSs will need to bolster a closer tie with the human element, through Human-in-the-Loop controls that take into consideration human intents, psychological states, emotions and actions inferred through sensory data.&&&The simulation method of the galvanic coupling intrabody communication with different signal transmission paths.&&&24/10/2015&&&612352

Our metrics go beyond some of the known practical secrecy measures, such as bit error rate and security gap, so as to make lower bound probabilistic guarantees on error rates over short blocklengths both preceding and following a secrecy decoder. Our techniques are especially useful in cases where application of traditional information-theoretic security measures is either impractical or simply not yet understood.&&&EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking&&&25/4/2013&&&12761018

Web searching is the most popular online activity and although search engines regularly use updated indexes to run quickly and efficiently, they sometimes fail to keep the user on their page for a long time. As such, it is important to have the lowest delay in response time. Therefore, it is essential to understand what load is supported by each search engine by conducting load testing. These tests have the objective of optimizing the performance of the application being tested, thus verifying the maximum amount of data that is processed. In this paper we conduct a comparative analysis of the four most popular web platform assessment tools, Apache JMeter, Apache Flood, The Grinder and Gatling.&&&Springer, Cham&&&319935263

By employing data sets from four resort hotels and addressing this issue as a classification problem in the scope of data science, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to build models for predicting booking cancellations with accuracy results in excess of 90. This research also demonstrates that despite what was alleged by Morales and Wang (2010), it is possible to predict with high accuracy whether a booking will be canceled.&&&IGI Global&&&522510543

Currently, LTE is becoming a 4G reference architecture due to its widespread adoption among leading operators of mobile telecommunications. LTE is therefore foreseen as an important foundation for future 5G networks. In the shift towards 5G, several open issues have to be worked out in LTE. They emerge due to severe requirements put on the infrastructure of the future networks. First, mobile users will expect high capacity channels, in which capacity is measured in several Gbps. Second, new applications will be considered with high densities of connected devices. Third, 5G networks will have to accommodate new types of connected devices such as household appliances, meters and connected cars. Fourth, direct device-to-device (D2D) communication will have to be formulated for sharing information in a local context.&&&Elsevier Ltd&&&785480539&&&ICN/DTN for Public Safety in Mobile Networks&&&231&&&247

However, with the ever-increasing aging world population, it is becoming even more important to better design for older people, taking their wants, needs, desires, and expectations into account as the underlying basis for design. Amongst other issues that need to be addressed, this also requires modifying current design practices, including commonly used design methodologies, to make them more effective for targeting aging user populations.&&&Springer, Cham&&&030293895&&&Lecture Notes in Computer Science&&&719&&&724

This information is essential to reduce the effort spent by developers when searching for needed source code artifacts.

This context model adapts automatically to changes in the focus of attention of the developer by detecting context transitions.

Thus, the Fog rises as an extension to the Cloud able to provide mobility support, geographical distribution, and lower latency, by moving the services closer to the users, to the edge of the network. This new environment located at the edge comes with its own orchestration challenges. Among the orchestration functions that must be adapted to this new environment is scheduling.

Physicians need to classify each specific type of epilepsy based on different data, e.g., types of seizures, events and exams' results. This work presents a text mining approach to support medical decisions relating to epilepsy diagnosis and classification in children. We propose a text mining process that, using patient medical records, applies ontologies and named entities recognition as preprocessing steps, then applying K-Nearest Neighbors as a white-box lazy method to classify each instance. Results on real medical records suggest that the proposed framework shows good performance and clear interpretations, albeit the reduced volume of available training data.&&&IEEE&&&467358002&&&2013 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services&&&3

Such residual faults can ultimately lead to failures, often incurring considerable risks or costs. Online Failure Prediction (OFP) is a fault-tolerance technique that attempts to predict the occurrence of failures in the near future and thus prevent/mitigate their consequences. Combined with recent technological developments, Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully used to create predictive models for OFP. However, as failures are rare events, failure data are often not available for building accurate models.&&&IEEE&&&728198712&&&2020 IEEE 31st International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering&&&9

The enhanced capabilities of these access networks has spearheaded the cloud computing paradigm, where the end-users aim at having the services accessible anytime and anywhere. The services availability is also related with the end-user device, where one of the major constraints is the battery lifetime. Therefore, it is necessary to assess and minimize the energy consumed by the end-user devices, given its significance for the user perceived quality of the cloud computing services. In this paper, an empirical methodology to measure network interfaces energy consumption is proposed.&&&IEEE&&&457716676&&&2011 First International Symposium on Network Cloud Computing and Applications&&&21
